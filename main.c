/*
 * Problem Statement :-
 *      Sudesh Sharma is a linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can
 *      handle student queries. Since there can be multiple requests at any time he wishes
 *      to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that everyone gets a fair
 *      share of his time. He will log into the System from 10am to 12am only. He wants to
 *      have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the
 *      same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he spent on
 *      handling queries and average query time.

 *
 * Solution Implemented :-
 *      Since we are planning to have different queues for students and faculties and each
 *      of them needs a fixed time quantum and in order to maximize the efficiency i will be
 *      calculating optimal time quantum to get the maximum efficiency in the shortest period
 *      of time.
